  @file mp_dictionary.sas
  @brief Creates a portal (libref) into the SQL Dictionary Views
  @details Provide a libref and the macro will create a series of views against
  each view in the special PROC SQL dictionary libref.

  This is useful if you would like to visualise (navigate) the views in a SAS
  client such as Base SAS, Enterprise Guide, or Studio (or [Data Controller](
  https://datacontroller.io)).

  It works by extracting the dictionary.dictionaries view into
  YOURLIB.dictionaries, then uses that to create a YOURLIB.{viewName} for every
  other dictionary.view, eg:

      proc sql;
      create view YOURLIB.columns as select * from dictionary.columns;

  Usage:

      libname demo "/lib/directory";
      %mp_dictionary(lib=demo)

  Or, to just create them in WORK:

      %mp_dictionary()

  If you'd just like to browse the dictionary data model, you can also check
