  @file
  @brief Performs a wrapped \%include
  @details This macro wrapper is necessary if you need your included code to
  know that it is being \%included.

  If you are using %include in a regular program, you could make use of the
  following macro variables:

  @li SYSINCLUDEFILEDEVICE
  @li SYSINCLUDEFILEDIR
  @li SYSINCLUDEFILEFILEREF
  @li SYSINCLUDEFILENAME

  However these variables are NOT available inside a macro, as documented here:
https://documentation.sas.com/doc/en/pgmsascdc/9.4_3.5/mcrolref/n1j5tcc0n2xczyn1kg1o0606gsv9.htm

  This macro can be used in place of the %include statement, and will insert
  the following (equivalent) global variables:

  @li _SYSINCLUDEFILEDEVICE
  @li _SYSINCLUDEFILEDIR
  @li _SYSINCLUDEFILEFILEREF
  @li _SYSINCLUDEFILENAME

  These can be used whenever testing _within a macro_.  Outside of the macro,
  the regular automatic variables will still be available (thanks to a
  concatenated file list in the include statement).

  Example usage:

      filename example temp;
      data _null_;
        file example;
        put '%macro test();';
        put '%put &=_SYSINCLUDEFILEFILEREF;';
        put '%put &=SYSINCLUDEFILEFILEREF;';
        put '%mend; %test()';
        put '%put &=SYSINCLUDEFILEFILEREF;';
      run;
      %mp_include(example)

  @param [in] fileref The fileref of the file to be included. Must be provided.
  @param [in] prefix= (_) The prefix to apply to the global variables.
  @param [in] opts= (SOURCE2) The options to apply to the %inc statement
  @param [in] errds= (work.mp_abort_errds) There is no clean way to end a
    process within a %include called within a macro.  Furthermore, there is no
    way to test if a macro is called within a %include.  To handle this
    particular scenario, the %mp_abort() macro will test for the existence of
    the `_SYSINCLUDEFILEDEVICE` variable and return the outputs (msg,mac) inside
    this dataset.
    It will then run an abort cancel FILE to stop the include running, and pass
    the dataset back.

    IMPORTANT NOTE - it is NOT possible to read this dataset as part of _this_
    macro! When running abort cancel FILE, ALL macros are closed, so instead it
    is necessary to invoke "%mp_abort(mode=INCLUDE)" OUTSIDE of macro wrappers.
